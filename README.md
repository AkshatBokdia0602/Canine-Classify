# Canine-Classify 🐶

**Canine Classify** is a deep learning-based project designed to detect and classify different breeds of dogs in photos. It leverages **Detectron2**, a powerful object detection library, to accurately identify the presence of a dog and determine its breed from a pre-defined set of classes.
